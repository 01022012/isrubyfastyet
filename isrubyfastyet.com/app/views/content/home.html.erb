<h1>Is Ruby Fast Yet?</h1>

<p>Practical, comparative benchmarks of Ruby implementations. Thanks to <%= link_to "RVM", "https://rvm.io/" %> for Ruby setup and compiling. <%= link_to "Github", "https://github.com/brianhempel/isrubyfastyet" %></p>

  <h3>About the Benchmarks</h3>
  <p>
    This is intended as a Ruby benchmark rather than a Rails one; <%= link_to "Rails", 'http://rubyonrails.org/' %> just happens to be the best thing out there to benchmark. Rails presents the greatest challenge to Ruby implementations.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a Ruby benchmark, the Rails version is locked to 3.1.3 and the server is WEBrick.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would love to compare Ruby to other dynamic languages. However, I don't know of any sufficiently complex, real-world applications that are also cross-language. So right now the question is more like, "Is Ruby Faster Than Before?"

  <h3>Hardware</h3>
  <p>
    Mid-2007 MacBook Pro<br>
    2.2GHz Core 2 Duo<br>
    6GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM<br>
    WD Scorpio Black 7200RPM 320GB Hard Drive<br>
    Mac OS X 10.6<br>
    When running the benchmark, the computer fans are spun up to maximum speed courtesy of <%= link_to "smcFanControl", "http://www.eidac.de/?cat=40" %>. JRuby, in particular, runs hot. The benchmark premptively runs the fans and pauses between runs in order to cool off. These measures give JRuby at least a 25% speed gain. However, JRuby still might be running slower than it would on a box with appropriate cooling.
